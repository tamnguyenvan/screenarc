## ✨ Overview

ScreenArc is a powerful, cross-platform screen recording and editing application designed to help you create professional, engaging videos with minimal effort. It's the perfect tool for developers, educators, and content creators who need to produce high-quality tutorials, demos, and presentations.

The core philosophy of ScreenArc is to **automate the tedious parts of video editing**. It intelligently tracks your mouse movements and clicks, automatically creating smooth, cinematic pan-and-zoom effects that keep your audience focused on the action.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🎬 High-Quality Recording:**
    *   Capture your entire screen, a specific application window, or a custom-defined area.
    *   Support for multi-monitor setups.
    *   Simultaneously record your webcam as an overlay.

*   **🖱️ Cinematic Mouse Tracking:**
    *   The cornerstone feature: automatically detects mouse clicks and creates smooth pan-and-zoom animations to highlight areas of action. No manual keyframing needed!

*   **✂️ Powerful & Intuitive Editor:**
    *   **Frame Customization:** Easily change aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 1:1), set beautiful backgrounds (colors, gradients, or wallpapers), and adjust padding, borders, and shadows.
    *   **Preset System:** Save your favorite styles as presets and apply them instantly to new projects.
    *   **Timeline Editing:** A visual timeline to add, edit, or remove auto-generated effects. Easily "cut" mistakes or unwanted sections.

*   **📤 Flexible Export Options:**
    *   Export your final videos in standard formats like **MP4** and **GIF**.
    *   Control output settings like resolution (up to 2K) and frame rate.
