# ScreenArc - High-Level Goals

## Vision

To create a streamlined, powerful screen recording and editing application for Linux, Windows, and macOS, enabling creators to produce professional-looking, engaging videos with minimal effort. ScreenArc aims to be the go-to tool for tutorials, demos, and presentations by automating complex editing tasks like cursor tracking and zooming.

## Core Features (Phase 1)

1.  **High-Quality Screen Recording**
    *   Capture the entire screen, a specific application window, or a custom-defined area. *(Note: Current implementation focuses on full-screen capture on Linux, with other modes planned).*
    *   Support for high-resolution recording (up to 2K and beyond).
    *   Record system audio and microphone input. *(Note: Audio recording is a planned feature not yet implemented).*

2.  **Cinematic Mouse Tracking & Auto-Zoom**
    *   The cornerstone feature: automatically detects mouse clicks from recorded metadata.
    *   Creates smooth, cinematic pan-and-zoom animations to highlight the area of action, keeping the viewer engaged.
    *   Provides customizable easing functions for a polished, professional feel.

3.  **Powerful & Intuitive Editing Studio**
    *   **Frame Customization:**
        *   Easily change the video's aspect ratio (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, etc.).
        *   Set custom backgrounds: solid colors, gradients, or uploaded images.
        *   Adjust padding, border radius, shadows, and border styles for the main video frame.
    *   **Timeline Editing:**
        *   A visual timeline to review and modify the recording.
        *   Manually add, edit, or remove auto-generated zoom effects.
        *   Define and manage "cut" segments to easily remove mistakes or unwanted parts of the video.

4.  **Flexible Export Options**
    *   Export final videos in standard formats like MP4 and GIF.
    *   Control output settings, including resolution (HD, 1080p, 2K), frame rate (FPS), and quality.

## Future Goals (Post-Core)

*   **Webcam Integration:** Record webcam footage simultaneously and display it as an overlay (e.g., in a corner circle).
*   **Audio Transcription:** Automatically generate and display subtitles from recorded audio.
*   **Video Annotations:** Add text, shapes, arrows, and blur effects directly onto the video.
*   **AI-Powered Enhancements:** Explore features like AI-powered scene detection, automatic removal of silences, or generative backgrounds.

## Target Audience

*   Software Developers creating tutorials or bug reports.
*   Educators and Teachers preparing online course materials.
*   Content Creators producing product demos and software reviews.
*   UI/UX Designers showcasing prototypes and user flows.
